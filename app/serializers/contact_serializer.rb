# application alert recipient has been added as a contact manually in the provider
# contact serializer (../provider_serializer.rb:38). It has not been added into
# the enum in the contact model as it's does not share the name and email attribute.
# It is simply a contact email address and is more suited to sit in the ucas
# preferences model.
