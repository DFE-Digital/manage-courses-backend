      "Text": "This 1-year postgraduate course will recommend you, on completion, for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) with full PGCE, to teach children aged 5-11 in primary, infant, junior, first and middle schools (including 90 CATS points towards a Masters). \r\n\r\nOn this programme you will undertake your training in a special school and you will spend a term in each of the 3 primary age groups: Key stage 1, Lower Key Stage 2 and Upper Key Stage 2.\r\n\r\nYou will be supported by an in-school 'professional mentor', a 'personal tutor' at the University and a 'link tutor' who will span both. Gateway also provides access to a 'lead mentor' who will support your professional development, facilitate opportunities for you to network with other trainees and ensure the support received throughout the training year is of the highest quality. \r\n\r\nThe training programme has been developed to help you to feel part of the school team from day 1. You will undertake an in-school induction at the end of the summer term prior to starting your training, for up to 10 days, and this will be followed by a University induction during late August. \r\n\r\nYou will be in school from the first day of the school year so from the very start you will be treated as a member of staff and will attend staff meetings and development days. Your learning will be supported through structured training days at the University, complemented by your time in school to put the theory into practice and begin to develop your own skills in the classroom. Throughout the training year the amount of teaching that you take on will be gradually increased at a pace to suit you, supported at all times by in-school and academic mentoring. \r\n\r\nRunning alongside the University taught programme are a series of training days led by the Gateway Alliance, these sessions focus on key areas of practice and also provide a great opportunity for networking with other Gateway trainees.\r\n\r\nAs a salaried trainee you will be employed by your 'host school' for the duration of the course and receive a salary equivalent to point 1 of the unqualified teacher pay scale.  Please note, the University of Warwick currently charge a fee of £2,000, payable by ALL salaried trainees, to cover the cost of the accredited element of the course. Further details about this can be obtained from the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
