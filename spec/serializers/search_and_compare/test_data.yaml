  Name: about this training programme
  Text: "School Direct is a school-led teacher training route where the majority of
    your time will be spent in your training school. The content and the focus of
    the training programme will be targeted to meet your individual needs. You will
    also have the benefit of receiving training from Middlesex University and making
    use of their extensive resources, including the library and student support services.
    \r\n\r\nOur School Direct programme also provides you with the opportunity to
    gain a postgraduate qualification (PGCert Teaching), which can be used towards
    a Masters award in the future. This will enable you to develop your skills for
    teaching and for understanding the interrelationship between learning and teaching,
    as you develop into a critically reflective practitioner. "

  Text: 'We are looking for creative, enthusiastic and hard working trainee teachers
    who can bring learning to life for our children. Every day in school is different
    so you will need to be flexible and adaptable. We would like you to have had some
    experience of working with young people of primary age, but this does not need
    to be paid work. It could be helping with a sports team, drama group, youth group
    or voluntary work in schools. We welcome career changers and the skills that can
    be transferred between professions. '
