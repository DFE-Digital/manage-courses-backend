# Manage Courses Backend

## Prerequisites

### Native

- Ruby 2.6.1
- postgresql-9.6 postgresql-contrib-9.6

### Docker

- docker
- docker-compose

## Setting up the app in development

### Native

1. Run `bundle install` to install the gem dependencies
2. Run `rails db:setup` to create a development and testing database
3. Run `bundle exec rails server` to launch the app on http://localhost:3000.

### Docker

Run this in a shell and leave it running:

```
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

You can then follow the log output with

```
docker-compose logs --follow
```

The first time you run the app, you need to set up the databases. With the above command running separately, do:

```
docker-compose exec web /bin/sh -c "bundle exec rails db:setup"
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

## Accessing API

### V1

[See API Docs](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/manage-courses-backend/blob/master/docs/api.md)

Quick check that it's working in local development with the token "bats"
configured in `config/environments/development.rb`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/2019/subjects.json -H "Authorization: Bearer bats"
```

### V2

#### Development

In development mode, authenticating with V2 of the API relies on an email
address of an existing use in the database being supplied as the bearer token.
An example HTTP request would look like:

```
GET /api/v2/users.json
Authorization: Bearer user@digital.education.gov.uk
```

or with curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v2/users.json -H "Authorization: Bearer user@digital.education.gov.uk"
```

#### Production

In production mode the bearer token is an HMAC-encrypted JWT with the JSON payload:

```
{
  "email": "user@digital.education.gov.uk"
}
```

Encoding the payload can be done with the [Ruby `jwt` gem](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt):

```
JWT.encode payload, SECRET, 'HS256'
```

## Linting

It's best to lint just your app directories and not those belonging to the framework:

```bash
bundle exec govuk-lint-ruby app config db lib spec --format clang

or

docker-compose exec web /bin/sh -c "bundle exec govuk-lint-ruby app config db lib spec Gemfile --format clang"
```

##Â CI variables

You'll need to define the `AZURE_CR_PASSWORD` in Travis in order to successfully build and publish. This can be done using this command:

```bash
travis encrypt AZURE_CR_PASSWORD="xxx" --add
```

## Sentry

To track exceptions through Sentry, configure the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable:

```
SENTRY_DSN=https://aaa:bbb@sentry.io/123 rails s
```
