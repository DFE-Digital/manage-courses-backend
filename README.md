# Manage Courses Backend

## Prerequisites

- docker
- docker-compose

## Setting up the app in development

Run this in a shell and leave it running:

```
$ docker-compose up
```

The first time you run the app, you need to set up the databases. With the above command running separately, do:

```
$ docker-compose exec web /bin/sh -c "bundle exec rails db:setup"
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

## Accessing API

[See API Docs](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/manage-courses-backend/blob/master/docs/api.md)

## Linting

It's best to lint just your app directories and not those belonging to the framework:

```bash
$ docker-compose exec web /bin/sh -c "bundle exec govuk-lint-ruby app config db lib spec --format clang"
```

##Â CI variables

You'll need to define the `AZURE_CR_PASSWORD` in Travis in order to successfully build and publish. This can be done using this command:

```bash
travis encrypt AZURE_CR_PASSWORD="xxx" --add
```
